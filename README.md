This is a Recruitment Task Application for a React Developer position.

## Tech Stack:
- Typescript
- Next.js
- Pexels API Client Library

## Getting Started

First, go to the desired directory and clone the git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m4tt133/pexels-app.git
```

## Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install 
```

## Don't forget to create a .env file with these variables:

```bash
#Assuming that PEXELS API KEY is not sensitive
NEXT_PUBLIC_PEXELS_API_KEY=Your Pexels Api Key Goes Here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=Dev: http://localhost:3000 | Production: Your Domain
```

## Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## You can also build the project using:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

It will spin the local server up at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This project uses [`Next.js`][(https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font](https://nextjs.org/).
